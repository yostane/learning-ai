#  Prompt with AI

## Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering involves the design and creation of prompts that are used to elicit specific responses or actions from AI models or interactive systems. These prompts are carefully crafted to guide the behavior or generate particular outputs from the AI, such as generating natural language responses, providing recommendations, or completing specific tasks.

### Definition

In the context of AI language models, prompt engineering is especially important for shaping the model's behavior and output. By designing prompts effectively, engineers can influence the model's responses and ensure that it generates coherent, relevant, and accurate content.

There are four main areas to consider when writing an effective prompt. You don’t need to use all four, but using a few will help!

- `Persona`: Who is the user you're writing for? What are their skills and knowledge?
- `Task`: What specific action do you want the user to perform?
- `Context`: What information does the user need to know to complete the task?
- `Format`: What is the desired output of the task?

**Example Prompt:**
* [`Persona`] You are a Google Cloud program manager. 
* [`Task`] Draft an executive summary email
* [`Context`] to [person description] based on [details about relevant program docs]. 
* [`Format`] Limit to bullet points.

By using "act as," you are establishing a specific context for the language model and guiding it to understand the type of task or request you are making. This helps to set the right expectations and provides the language model with the necessary context to generate a response tailored to the defined role.

```
"Act as a creative writing assistant and generate a short story based 
on a prompt about a futuristic world where robots have become sentient."
```

### Framework : Chain of Thought

![Chain of Thought](../assets/images/cot.png)

Introduced in Wei et al. (2022), chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps. You can combine it with few-shot prompting to get better results on more complex tasks that require reasoning before responding.

### Framework : ReAct Prompting
Yao et al., 2022 introduced a framework named ReAct where LLMs are used to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner.

Generating reasoning traces allow the model to induce, track, and update action plans, and even handle exceptions. The action step allows to interface with and gather information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments.

The ReAct framework can allow LLMs to interact with external tools to retrieve additional information that leads to more reliable and factual responses.
